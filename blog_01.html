            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p>The Yamaha YZF-R1 is a super motorbike which packed with YZR-M1 MotoGP technology, a crossplane engine, short wheelbase chassis and high-tech electronics. This bike was born for the track. 200PS, 199kg and a 1,405mm wheelbase makes it so special. ZR-M1 MotoGP derived crossplane technology, this supersport pushes out strong linear torque with outstanding traction.</p>

      <h3>Generations</h3>
      <div class="left-allign">
      <h4>Generation 01 (1998–1999)</h4> <br>
      <p>Yamaha launched the YZF-R1 after redesigning the Genesis engine to create a more compact engine by raising the gearbox input shaft and allowing the gearbox output shaft to be placed beneath it. This 'stacked gearbox' was followed by other manufacturers. Compacting the engine made the engine much shorter, allowing the wheelbase to be shortened. This allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized center of gravity. The swingarm could be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short 1,385 mm (54.5 in). Four 40 mm Keihin CV carburetors fed fuel to the engine. It had KYB upside down 41 mm front forks and 300 mm semi-floating disk brakes. The instrument panel was electrical with a self diagnosis system and digital speed readout.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-allign">
      <h4>Generation 02 (2000–2001)</h4><br>
      <p>In 2000, Yamaha introduced a series of changes to improve the bike, and minor changes to the bodywork to allow for better long duration ride handling. Yamaha's main design goal was to sharpen the pre-existing bike and not to redesign it. The dry weight was reduced five pounds to 414 lb</p><br>
      <p>Mechanically, the carburetors were re-jetted in an effort to improve throttle response, especially in the low end, all the way up to the bike's 11,750 rpm redline. The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal oil ways to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced tappet clearance, provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow chrome moly shift shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned shift linkage and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left-allign">
      <h4>Generation 03 (2002–2003)</h4><br>
      <p>A new fuel injection system was introduced for the 2002 year, which worked like a carburetor by employing a CV carburetor slide controlled by vacuum created by the engine. With a similar power output to the 2000-2001 bike, the engine remained largely the same. One notable improvement was the use of new cylinder sleeves of a high silicon content alloy containing magnesium that minimized heat induced distortion, reducing oil consumption. Also in 2002, Yamaha released the newly developed Deltabox frame.</p><br>
      <P>In 2002, Cycle World reported fuel mileage of 38 mpg‑US (6.2 L/100 km; 46 mpg‑imp), a 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) time of 2.9 seconds, a 0 to 1⁄4 mi (0.00 to 0.40 km) time of 10.32 seconds at 137.60 mph (221.45 km/h), and a top speed of 167 mph (269 km/h).</P>
      </div>
      <div class="right-allign">
      <h4>Generation 04 (2004–2005)</h4><br>
      <p>With the competition advancing, Yamaha made some major changes to the model. This included style updates, like an under seat twin exhaust, and performance upgrades including radial brakes, and, for the first time an R1 Ram-air intake. Furthermore, the tendency for wheelies by earlier productions was reduced by changing the geometry of the frame and weight distribution. The all-new engine was no longer used as a stressed member of the chassis, and had a separate top crankcase and cylinder block.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left-allign">      
      <h4>Generation 05 (2006)</h4><br>
      <p>The swingarm was extended by 20 mm (0.79 in) to reduce acceleration instability. In this year, Yamaha also released a limited edition version in original Yamaha racing colors to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The model (LE/SP) had a Kenny Roberts front and rear custom Öhlins suspension units developed by the same team as the YZR-M1 MotoGP bike. Custom forged aluminum Marchesini wheels specifically designed for the LE shaved nearly a pound off the unsprung weight. A back torque-limiting slipper clutch, and an integrated lap timer rounded out the package, making the LE virtually a production racer. Only 500 units were made for the United States with another 500 units for Europe.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-allign">
      <h4>Generation 06 (2007–2008)</h4><br>
      <p>An all-new YZF-R1 for the 2007 model year was announced on 8 October 2006. It had an all-new inline four-cylinder engine, going back to a more conventional four-valves per cylinder, rather than Yamaha's trade mark five-valve Genesis layout. It also had the Yamaha Chip Control Intake (YCC-I) electronic variable-length intake funnel system, Yamaha Chip Control Throttle (YCC-T) fly-by-wire throttle system, slipper-type clutch, all-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers with 310 mm discs, a wider radiator, and M1 styling on the new large ram-air ports in the front fairing. There were no major changes for 2008. Power at the rear wheel was 156.7 hp (116.9 kW) @ 10,160 rpm.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left-allign">
      <h4>Generation 07 (2009–2014)</h4><br>
      <p>In late 2008, Yamaha announced they would release an all new R1 for 2009. The new R1 takes engine technology from the M1 MotoGP bike with its cross plane crankshaft. Crossplane technology puts each connecting rod 90° from the next, with an uneven firing interval of 270°- 180°- 90°- 180°. The 2009 R1 was the first production sportbike to use a crossplane crankshaft.</p><br>
      <p>Another advancement included on the 2009 model was D-Mode Throttle Control Valve Mapping, which allows a rider to choose between three distinct maps depending on the rider's environment. Each mode of operation controls YCC-T characteristics, changing how the R1 reacts to rider input. The first mode is Standard Mode, which delivers performance for a wide variety of driving conditions. The second mode is "A" mode which will give a rider more available power in the lower to mid RPM range. The third mode is "B" mode, which is a dial back of the previous mode, designed to soften throttle response in inclement weather and heavy traffic. D-Mode throttle control is controlled by the rider through a forward mode button near the throttle. The instrument panel is more comprehensive than previous models, and the 2009/2010 Yamaha YZF-R1 model had a gear indicator as standard.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-allign">
      <h4>Generation 08 (2015–present)</h4><br>
      <p>At the centennial EICMA motorcycle show, Yamaha officially unveiled a new generation of R1. It is similar to MotoGP's 2005–Present YZR M1. The new bike has an electronics package that includes a sophisticated Traction Control (TCS) and Slide Control System (SCS), antiwheelie Lift Control System (LIF), linked antilock brakes, Launch Control System (LCS), Quick Shift System (QSS), and selectable power modes. The Slide Control System on the Yamaha YZF-R1 is the first on a production motorcycle.</p>
